Loan Calculator
You are given the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a loan calculator. Your goal is to fill in the JavaScript to make the loan calculator functional. The calculator takes an amount to loan (the principle), a term in years, and a yearly rate. The output should be the monthly payment of the loan.

To calculate the monthly payment, use the following formula:

monthly payment= (P * i) / (1 − ( 1 + i ) − n)

Where:

P = Amount of principle
i = periodic interest rate (in our case yearly rate ÷ 12)
n = total number of payments (years × 12)

There is also a jasmine test file (calculator-test.js). Your goal is to write tests for the calculateMontlyPayment function. There are a few suggested tests, but if you can think of more, feel free to add to it.
